## Elden Ring

_Elden Ring_ releases tomorrow. I am more excited than I've been since the release of _Sekiro_, the last game that _Fromsoft_ released. And it's getting great reviews! Better than great, to be honest. One that stands out in particular is the review in _The Guardian_, written by Simon Parkin.

The last two paragraphs stand out, in particular:

> It is not an accomplishment in itself for a game to be large, or long. An algorithm could theoretically toss off a virtual universe, and another could fill it with busywork. It is inane to equate scale with value and enrichment. Elden Ring’s hills, valleys, mountaintop settlements and underground palaces offer something far rarer: true texture, variety, and long-term intrigue.... Its final gift is the assurance that, whatever monsters lurk in a broken world, with perseverance and cooperation, they too can be overcome – all without losing the mystery and wonder that makes our existence beguiling, infuriating, and fascinating.

One of the inevitable consequences of a big _Fromsoft_ release is another round of discourse on difficulty and video game accesibilty and approachability. I'm sure that this release will be no different, despite several reviews nothing that it is "more approachable" than previous entries into this spiritual series.

This is one of those internet conversations that I don't fully know what my own stance is, or even if I have a stance. For that reason, I'm actually looking forward to seeing what people make of _Elden Ring_'s approachability. Still, any gaming "discourse" inevitably stirs up the Gamergate underbelly of the community. Already, I'm seeing jokes about needing an easier setting for gaming journalists...

## Lost Medieval Texts

As summarized by Lithub, a recent publication in _Science_ used a model for estimating the number of "unseen species" to estimate the number of medieval texts that have survived, based on the number that we know to exist. They estimated that only **9% of medieval texts** from 600-1450 AD have survived!

In one sense, this isn't surprising. It feels like a generally true statement that most of human history has been lost due to the forces of time marching on, as well as our own penchant for destruction. Still, the statement gives me the same gut twisting feeling as the knowledge that I will never be able to read even 1% of the books that are released in my lifetime.
