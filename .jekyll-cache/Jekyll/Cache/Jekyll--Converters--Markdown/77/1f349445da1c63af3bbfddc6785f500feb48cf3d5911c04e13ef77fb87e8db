I"`<p>Hello and welcome!</p>

<p>My name is Francis. I’m a material scientist actively researching in fields related to nanotechnology.</p>

<p>My interests are varied, both inside and outside of science. Actually, it goes beyond just being varied. My interests and attention are scattered. I read an article or book on a subject that I find fascinating, add the topic to the growing list of rabbit holes that I should follow up on one day, and then move on to the next topic. Of course, I rarely return to dig deeper.</p>

<p>This website is an attempt to rectify the problem of surface level reading. My goal is to write here regularly, to work on building a trail of thoughts that I can look back on to track my intellectual growth. I want to do more than just share the articles and books that I’m reading. Since this is a public website, I am hoping that the act of composing posts for (theoretical) public consumption will force me to engage more deeply with the topics that I’m reading about.</p>

<p>We’ll see how this goes. If nothing else, it has been a fun afternoon learning to set up this website.</p>
